# flappybird
A fully-functioning one-day coding challenge to build the Flappy Bird game! Some of the features I liked-
- collision detection built-in, so when the bird hits a pipe, game over
- loved building it in Javascript and had fun using styled components, React, and the oroginal graphics to give it a great feel
- each time the bird passes through the pipes, update the score in the scoreboard
